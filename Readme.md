Starfall Scripting Environment
----------

Stupid Starfall Branch that makes the SF Helper load with E2 Docs.  
Currently doesn't have support for constants and type functions like xco:yield.

Don't think it'd be that hard to do it but just putting this branch here if someone wants to finish it if i don't get to.
